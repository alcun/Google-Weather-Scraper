Using python to scrape and display weather data for queried location from google weather api.

Change the 'query value' for different results.

CURRENT VERSION:
Works as intended, displaying queried location, temp, unit and desc

TO DO:
I could add:
time
weather forecasts for a few days ahead
a way to export result as .csv file
a ui where the user is prompted for query and parameters like time
